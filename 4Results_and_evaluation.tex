You have now stated your problem, and you are ready to do something
about it!  \emph{How} are you going to do that? What methods do you
use?  You also need to review existing literature to justify your
choices, meaning that why you have chosen the method to be applied in
your work.

If you have not yet done any (real) metholodogical courses (but chosen introduction courses of different areas that are listed in the
methodological courses list), now is the time to do so or at least
check through material of suitable methodological courses. Good
methodologial courses that consentrates especially to methods are
presented in Table. Remember to explain the
content of the tables (as with figures). In the table, the last column gives the research area where the methods are often used. Here we used table to give an example of tables. Abbreviations and Acronyms is also a long table. The difference is that longtables can continue to next page.
