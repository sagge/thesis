\label{chapter:conclusions}

This seminar report presented a proposal for automated acceptance testing environment for payment terminal software and addressed the theories and problems related to the topic. Presented AAC environment was joint combination of open source hardware and software and was formed by the requirements of a Eficode Oy's customer.

Literature review of this seminar report addressed the four problem statements introduced in the beginning of this seminar report.

This seminar report also lays a promise of how commonly and inexpensively available components can be used in relatively demanding applications. By combining different open source products, highly adaptive AAC environment could be possibly created for the needs of automated acceptance testing of payment terminal software.
